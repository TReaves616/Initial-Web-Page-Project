<h2>Summary</h2>
    <!--following is a paragraph-->
<p>I am having an amazing time in my journey to becoming a software engineer. I am quite eager about learning the intricacies of the various fields of study within the computer science field and I am excitedly looking forward to working with other software engineers and web developers in the future.

In my personal life I have a rather eclectic range of interests including mathematics, physics, art, esoteric philosophy, and music. </p>
