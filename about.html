<h2>Summary</h2>
    <!--following is a paragraph-->
<p> Originally I began attending college to obtain a Bachelor of Science degree with an emphasis on mathematics. However, as the Allen Saunders 1957 Readers digest quote, famously referenced by John Lennon, said “Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans.” I haven’t yet been able to obtain my degree, and perhaps never will, but that is alright. I am having an amazing time learning software engineering and I look forward to the next steps in my journey.</p>

 <p>I have enjoyed my experience at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful </a> and I would highly recommend their program to anyone seeking to break into the field of computer science.</p>
